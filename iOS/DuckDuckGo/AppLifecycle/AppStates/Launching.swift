import Core
import UIKit

/// Represents the transient state where the app is being prepared for user interaction after being launched by the system.
/// - Usage:
///   - This state is typically associated with the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method.
///   - It is responsible for performing the app's initial setup, including configuring dependencies and preparing the UI.
///   - As part of this state, the `MainViewController` is created and set as the `rootViewController` of the app's primary `UIWindow`.
/// - Transitions:
///   - `Foreground`: Standard transition when the app completes its launch process and becomes active.
///   - `Background`: Occurs when the app is launched but transitions directly to the background, e.g:
///     - The app is protected by a FaceID lock mechanism (introduced in iOS 18.0). If the user opens the app
///       but does not authenticate and then leaves.
///     - The app is launched by the system for background execution but does not immediately become active.
/// - Notes:
///   - Avoid performing heavy or blocking operations during this phase to ensure smooth app startup.
